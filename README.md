# Composing Software

## Notes

- _compose operator_: $ (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) $ means "f composed with g" or "f after g"
- _point free style_: writing functions without mentioning of the arguments
    - This reduces intermediary variables, which frees up the programmer's working memoryâ€”and reduces the surface for bugs.
